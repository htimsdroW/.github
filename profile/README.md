## End2End Test to ensure service is healthy

1. Go to [web app](https://proud-sky-0f4232d03.2.azurestaticapps.net/).
2. You should see Wordsmith in large, ASCII art letters, a form with a single input field and a single button. If there are recent, same year submissions, there should also be a list labeled "History" beneath.
3. Click the input field labeled "String to Reversify" and type a sentence.
3. Click the button labeled "Reverse!
4. Your sentence should now be visible to the right of "Input String:", and the reversed result should be visible to the right of "Reversed String:".
5. The history list should be updated on submission, and, unless there is heavy load, you should also be able to see your sentence in that list.
